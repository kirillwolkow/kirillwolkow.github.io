        <h3>How I started - 5th April, 2021</h3>
        <p>
            My coding journey started on march 15th, 2021. I started with a huge mistake. But first things first.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before I started this path I had little to zero knowledge about coding. The only thing I learned was a HTML based local pong game I programmed back in high school. But that would be all. To be honest, I had a partner who helped with the game, because I struggeled to find the correct tags to code it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After high school I got in touch with coding several times. Mostly within the Blockchain Technology. I work in the financial industry and I'm very curious about the Blockchain and its Technology behind it. But it's very hard to find good material or reliant people in the industry. The most people only have the dollar signs in their eyes, but they don't understand Blockchain in depth.
        </p>
        <p>
            That was the reason why I started to learn coding. Because only the people who wrote the code of Blockchain nad Co. really understand the Technology behind it. But since I got little to zero knowledge about coding and programming it was a bit hard to start.
        </p>
        <p>
            And also I made the mistake to start with Back-End Programming with JavaScript. For me it was very overwhelming to understand the tags and the science of the complex structure. So, I paused the lesson and switched to Web Development with HTML and CSS (more Front-End than Back-End).
        </p>
        <p>
            As you see, half a month later I started this project - my own journal/portfolio website. On this website I share my experiences as a programmer who started from scratch. And I am also looking for help within my post's. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Problem: The navigation bar has width: 100%, but there is a space on the left hand side (on the home page and all the sub-pages). I don't understand why this is. Since I don't have much padding or margin in my style.css. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you find the error in the code (you can look with Chrome Dev Tools) please reach to me. You find my contact informations on the "Contact" sub-page.

        <p>Kind regards</p>
