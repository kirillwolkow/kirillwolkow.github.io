        <h3>How I started - 5th of April, 2021</h3>
        <p>
            My coding journey started on march 15th, 2021. I started with a huge mistake. But first things first.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before I started this path I had little to zero knowledge about coding. The only thing I learned was a HTML based local pong game I programmed back in high school. But that would be all. To be honest, I had a partner who helped with the game, because I struggeled to find the correct tags to code it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After high school I got in touch with coding several times. Mostly within the Blockchain Technology. I work in the financial industry and I'm very curious about the Blockchain and its Technology behind it. But it's very hard to find good material or reliant people in the industry. The most people only have the dollar signs in their eyes, but they don't understand Blockchain in depth.
        </p>
        <p>
            That was the reason why I started to learn coding. Because only the people who wrote the code of Blockchain and Co. really understand the Technology behind it. But since I got little to zero knowledge about coding and programming it was a bit hard to start.
        </p>
        <p>
            And also I made the mistake to start with Back-End Programming with JavaScript. For me it was very overwhelming to understand the tags and the science of the complex structure. So, I paused the lesson and switched to Web Development with HTML and CSS (more Front-End than Back-End).
        </p>
        <p>
            As you see, half a month later I started this project - my own journal/portfolio website. On this website I share my experiences as a programmer who started from scratch. And I am also looking for help within my post's. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Problem: The navigation bar has width: 100%, but there is a space on the left hand side (on the home page and all the sub-pages). I don't understand why this is. Since I don't have much padding or margin in my style.css. 
        </p>
        <p>
            If you find the error in the code (you can look with Chrome Dev Tools) please reach to me. You find my contact informations on the "Contact" sub-page. If you write an email: Please insert the title of the journal post as the subject.
        </p>
        <p>Kind regards</p>

        <h3>Timeline - 6th of April, 2021</h3>
        <p>
            In today's post I cover the next few topics/projects which I have in my timeline. So that you know, where we stand and more important, where we'll go.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
            Project #1 - Website
        </p>
        <p>
            Until the end of April 2021 I want to finish the structure of this website. All pages will be accessible and full of content (except the portfolio page). I will add the following structures to this site:
            <ul>
                <li>Contact Formular</li>
                <li>Overall responsive design for multiple devices</li>
                <li>Maybe a commenting section after each post</li>
                <li>Social Media Buttons / Share Buttons</li>
                <li>More images/videos for the aesthetics</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
            Project #2 - Building Basic Android App w/ Java
        </p>
        <p>
            I don't know yet what kind of an app I want to develop. I'm not sure if I want to create a game or a functional app. But as soon as I know, I'll inform you guys. This project will launch in May/June
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
            Project #3 - Create A Video Game w/ Phaser.js
        </p>
        <p>
            For the third project, I want to develop a simple video game with Phaser.js. It will have either a Samurai theme or a Philosophical one. But this project will start in July/August.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
            Project #4 - Data Analysis
        </p>
        <p>
            Since I work in the financial industry I have a lot of contact with financial data. So it's a key component of my work to get and understand data. For my firm I want to develop a unique and specific software to visualize our data. This project will maybe start in September/October.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">Project #5 - Blockchain, Tokenization, Smart Contracts</p>
        <p>
            Last but not least: Start with the reason why I started coding. For the last chapter of this year I'll attack the coding experiences in the blockchain technology. Why this topic at last? The Blockchain Technology is for me a very complex subject which I have issues to understand. Since I realized, that I have to start with the basics, I have more patience in learning. And also I will be a better developer on top, when I start the big Blockchain Project.

        <p>
            Problem: I want to align the bulleted list above to the div. I tried it with display and text-align, but it doesn't function. Help!
        </p>
        <p>Kind regards</p>

        <h3>Added contact form - 9th of April, 2021</h3>
        <p>
            So, I now added a contact formular with and linked it to the server of formularchef.de. It's the first solution I found and it worked. Since the given day you can contact me via e-mail or formular!
        </p>
        <p>
            Since I don't want to stay in Webdevelopment, I won't make many advancements on this website. But it's a cool little project which helps me getting better at coding, researching, implementing and problem solving.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the next step I will create an overall responsive design for all devices. This will be a tricky one, since I'm not that good in box-coding of CSS. I may have to refresh the lessons from Code Academy and FreeCodeCamp first. 
        </p>
        <p>
            And also in the meantime I will start learning to program an app with Java for Android. Because I want to code and learn at the same time. Ok, ok, I know. Coding itself is learning. But I am behind my schedule so I have to do both.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kind regards
        </p>

        <h3>Added Social Share Buttons - 26th of April 2021</h3>

        <p>
            Long time no see. In recent time I had a lot stuff to do with my company. But now I'm back :-)
        </p>
        <p>
            So, I just added some Social Share Buttons. Since I don't use Facebook or Instagram. I added Twitter, Reddit & Github. In this way you can share this website. I chose those Social Media platforms because they are programmer friendly. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the "Contact" section I'll add some other Social Button to follow my profiles. I don't know if you guys need this, but it's a simple skill to learn. 
        </p>
        <p>
           After that, there will be images and videos on this site, so it looks more aesthetic. But step by step. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Kind regards
        </p>
